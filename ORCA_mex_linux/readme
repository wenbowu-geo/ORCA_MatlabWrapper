mex binary for the normal mode program ORCA

***********************************************************************************

ORCA normal mode program (contents of /src/):
	written by Evan Westwood, ARL
MEX wrapper and matlab function (sub_orca.c, ORCA_MEX.m, ORCA_MEX_example.m):
	written by Y.-T. Lin, WHOI
makefile prepared by Brendan DeCourcy, WHOI

***********************************************************************************

/src/ folder contains all necessary source files to compile on a linux system with
gfortran and a C compiler supported by Matlab. Issue command

>> make -f makefile

in the terminal to compile. Primary output is liborca.a, and sub_orca.mexa64.

- liborca.a: static library compiled with gfortran which contains all object files
			 needed to run ORCA. Called by mex wrapper sub_orca.c
- sub_orca.mexa64: mex binary file for Matlab on linux. Called by matlab function
				   ORCA_MEX.m, example of use provided in ORCA_MEX_example.m

***********************************************************************************

NOTES: 

1) Edit made to fortran source file 'svp_check.f', on line 186:
flag 'iibad' is now initialized to zero to avoid ORCA issuing 'stop' command
within Matlab erroneously.

2) Compiling source file 'tools.f' with this makefile issues the Warning that
on line 104 the REAL(4) variable 'x' is passed to the COMPLEX(4) 'data' argument
of subroutine 'four1'. This has not been fixed or investigated.

3) Some source files have been edited to declare data types consistent with those
given in the module source files. Changes here denoted by comment lines in the 
relevant source files:

	3a) in 'mode_fun.f' file, subroutine 'phi_xlay' is passed the variable 
        'ikconx' to 'ikcont', which is now declared as complex*16
	3b) in 'phz_calc.f' file, subroutine 'nzero_lay' is passed the variables
        'phi_t', 'phi_b', 'dphi_t', 'dphi_b', which are now declared as
        complex*16 rather than complex*8
    3c) in 'svp_check.f' file, subroutine 'peak_enter' is passed the variable
        'jlay', now declared as a real*8
